            "Jubail International School (JIS) is committed to its guiding statements and educational convictions i.e., High-Quality Education, Global Citizenship, Interculturalism, and Digital Citizenship by promoting inclusion, diversity, equity, and anti-racism. To educate students and the JIS community about these commitments, an awareness campaign was devised, and multiple activities were conducted throughout the year. I congratulate the ICT department, Mr. Waqqad, and Grade 11 students for creating this website to project school activities and the soft image of the school. The activities in general and this digital learning in specific must have helped the students to discover their latent talents. I extend my appreciation and best wishes to all students and their teachers for this job well done.  We are proud of you all."
